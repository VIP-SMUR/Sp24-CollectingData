    "#### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Walkability\n",
    "   - where can additional pedeestrian access be of use?\n",
    "2. Safety\n",
    "   - is the fastest rout from A to B the safest?\n",
    "3. Route optimization\n",
    "   - consider route factors such as slope, terrain, obstacles, pedestrian/non-pedestrian\n",
    "   - note: some route suggestions from Google Maps conain precomputed parameters, hence fast results\n",
    "4. Segregation\n",
    "   - highways can separate neighbourhoods and isolate low-income neighbourhoods\n",
    "   - can segregated areas be identified?\n",
    "5. Sustainability\n",
    "   - Mobility can be regarded as part of the life cycle assesment of buildings\n",
    "   - Example: Total employee commute time (resp. emissions) can differ depending on wether office building is outside the city or inside the city. Where should a new office building be built to minimize total employee commute time?\n",
